So heres the deal, 
The way you use this program is like the old Papyrus .ini files

1. Run 20 laps in your sim around the track
2. Read the tread reaming %
3. **Version 1.2 only does a single section of the tread, so just use the one your interested in, Inside-Middle-Out coming soon**
4. Open config.ini
5. Input each of your tread remaining values tot he file
6. ***Be sure that there are no spaces between the '='
7. Save the .ini and be sure to keep it in the same directory as the .exe
8. You can close the .ini if desired, but not necesary
9. Open the .exe
10. Type in number of laps to estimate tread for
11. Type the .ini that you saved
12. ***Yes you can save as many .ini files as you want**
13. The program will output the values that you requested
